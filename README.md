# What Is The Purpose Of This Program?
The goal of this program is to be able to complete your sparx maths homework faster and more efficiently.
It does this by automatically guessing your bookwork code and saving the answer to a folder. 
You are then able to type in a bookwork code to return the answer

# Features
 - Automatically guesses next bookwork code to save you from having to type it in.
 - Saves inputted answers to be returned to later incase of a bookwork check. (Discaimer: At time of writing you must manually type the answer into sparx **and** into this program)
 - Designed to be quick to use without unnessesary menus.
 - Very few dependencies
